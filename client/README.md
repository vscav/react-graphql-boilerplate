# React/GraphQL boilerplate (client)

## Quick start

`yarn` will install all necessary Node dependencies.

## Usage

As we have our own server, we can run Parcel in ``watch`` mode. This automatically rebuilds as files change and supports hot module replacement. So you can run the following command :

```sh
yarn watch
```
